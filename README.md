# Rock Paper Scissors - Console Game
A simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, built as a console application in JavaScript. This project was completed as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum to practice core JavaScript concepts.

## üéØ Overview
This is a browser-based game that runs entirely in the browser's console. It's a battle of wits against the computer! The user selects their move by typing it into a prompt, the computer randomly selects its move, and the result of the round is displayed in the console.

The primary goal of this project was to solidify understanding of fundamental JavaScript, including:

- Functions

- Variables

- Conditional statements (if/else)

- Loops

- The Math.random() method for generating computer choices

## üöÄ Features
- Play 5-round game against the computer.

- Case-insensitive input (e.g., "Rock", "ROCK", and "rock" are all valid).

- Live score tracking throughout the multi-round game.

- A clear announcement of the final winner at the end of the game.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

3. Open the browser's developer console (Usually F12 or Right-click -> Inspect -> Console).

4. The game will start automatically. Follow the prompts in the console.

5. When prompted, type your choice: rock, paper, or scissors.

6. The console will display the computer's choice and the result of the round.

7. After 5 rounds, the overall winner will be crowned!

## üîç What I Learned
This project was a fantastic exercise in applying basic JavaScript in a practical context. Key takeaways included:

- **Problem Decomposition:** Breaking down the game logic into smaller, manageable functions (e.g., getComputerChoice, playRound, game).

- **Control Flow:** Mastering if/else if/else statements to determine the winner based on the game's rules.

- **Random Number Generation:** Using Math.random() and Math.floor() to create a seemingly "intelligent" opponent.

- **Function Scope:** Understanding how to pass data between functions using parameters and return values.

- **Debugging:** Effectively using console.log() to trace the program's execution and identify issues.
